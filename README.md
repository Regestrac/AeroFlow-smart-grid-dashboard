## 🧬 Simulation Model

The simulation follows a physics-based model that calculates turbine behavior in real-time:

### Power Calculation
Power output is calculated using a simplified wind turbine power curve:
- **Cut-in speed**: 3 m/s (minimum wind to generate power)
- **Rated speed**: 12 m/s (optimal power generation)
- **Cut-out speed**: 25 m/s (safety shutdown)
- **Blade angle efficiency**: $\cos(\theta)$ where $\theta$ is blade pitch (0° = full exposure, 90° = feathered)
- **Stress penalty**: Reduces power as mechanical stress approaches failure
- **Formula**: $P = P_{max} \times \eta_{wind} \times \eta_{angle} \times \eta_{stress}$
- **Max power per turbine**: 2.5 MW

### Mechanical Stress
Stress accumulates based on environmental conditions:
- **Force calculation**: $F \propto v^2 \times \cos(\theta)$
- **Stress increases**: When high wind speed combines with low blade angle (maximum force)
- **Stress decreases**: During shutdown or low-force conditions (gradual recovery)
- **Failure threshold**: Stress > 90% triggers critical status, >95% causes failure

### Status Derivation
Turbine status is derived from stress and operational flags:
- **Optimal**: Stress ≤ 70%, turbine operational
- **Warning**: Stress 70-90%, requires attention
- **Critical**: Stress > 90%, imminent failure risk
- **Offline**: Manually shut down by operator
- **Maintenance**: Under scheduled maintenance

### Grid Stability
Overall grid stability (0-100%) is calculated from:
- Average mechanical stress of active turbines
- Availability penalty for offline turbines (5% per turbine)
- Formula: $Stability = 100 - (avgStress \times 0.8) - (offlineTurbines \times 5)$

### Temperature Simulation
Temperature responds to power output and stress:
- Increases with power generation and mechanical stress
- Gradual cooling toward ambient temperature (25°C)
- Simulates thermal inertia with delayed response

## 🎮 User Interface Walkthrough

### Header
- Displays project branding and status indicators
- Toggle button to open/close the Control Panel
- Shows system status: "Online", simulation delta, and hardware sync status

### Control Panel (Collapsible Sidebar)
- **Wind Speed Slider**: Adjust wind speed from 0-25 m/s with visual gradient
- **Blade Angle Dial**: Rotary control for blade pitch (0-90°)
- **Preset Buttons**:
  - **Calm Day**: 8 m/s wind, 45° blade angle (safe, low power)
  - **Storm Warning**: 22 m/s wind, 15° blade angle (high stress, high power)
  - **Grid Peak**: 18 m/s wind, 60° blade angle (balanced, optimal power)

### Grid View
- 2×3 grid layout displaying 6 turbines
- Each **Turbine Card** shows:
  - Animated spinning turbine icon (speed proportional to RPM)
  - Status badge with color coding (green/yellow/red/gray)
  - Real-time metrics: Power output (MW), RPM, Temperature (°C)
  - Mechanical stress progress bar (red when >80%)
  - Shutdown toggle button
  - Maintenance mode toggle
- **Energy Flow Canvas**: Animated dashed lines showing power transmission from each turbine to a central grid hub, with opacity and speed scaling with turbine output

### Telemetry Panel
- **Grid Stats Bar**: Large animated counters showing:
  - Total MW output (sum of all active turbines)
  - Grid Stability percentage
  - Number of active turbines
- **Power Line Chart**: Real-time line chart displaying:
  - Total MW over the last 60 seconds
  - Auto-scrolling x-axis
  - Smooth monotone curve interpolation
  - Grid stability overlay

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Simulation Engine (`src/engine/SimulationEngine.ts`)
- Pure TypeScript class, independent of React
- Manages complete grid state for 6 turbines
- Exposes `tick()` method called every 500ms
- Methods for toggling shutdown and maintenance modes
- Initial state with randomized baseline stress and temperature

### Physics Functions (`src/engine/physics.ts`)
Pure, testable functions for calculations:
- `calculatePower()`: Wind speed, blade angle, stress → MW output
- `calculateStress()`: Wind speed, blade angle, current stress → stress delta
- `deriveStatus()`: Stress, flags → turbine status
- `calculateGridStability()`: All turbines → stability percentage

### Custom Hooks
- **useSimulation()**: Sets up 500ms interval, drives simulation loop, handles cleanup
- **useTelemetry()**: Subscribes to power output, maintains rolling 120-point history (60s @ 500ms)

### Performance Optimizations
- React-agnostic simulation engine prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Canvas-based energy flow animation (performant for continuous animation)
- Memoized components where appropriate
- Efficient state updates via Zustand
- CSS animations for smooth UI transitions

### Design System
- **Background**: `#080C14` (near-black navy)
- **Surface**: `rgba(255,255,255,0.04)` glassmorphism with backdrop blur
- **Accent**: `#00D4FF` (electric cyan)
- **Warning**: `#F59E0B` (amber)
- **Critical**: `#EF4444` (red)
- **Optimal**: `#10B981` (emerald)
- **Typography**: System fonts with optimized legibility

### Micro-Animations
- Turbine blade spin (CSS animation, speed bound to RPM)
- Energy flow particles (Canvas requestAnimationFrame)
- Number transitions (Framer Motion spring animations)
- Card pulse on critical state (CSS keyframes)
- Smooth panel transitions (Framer Motion)
